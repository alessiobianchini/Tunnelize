# Tunnelize

Tunnelize is a command-line tool that allows you to easily forward HTTP or HTTPS requests from a remote server to a local instance. It is designed to facilitate secure, simple, and reliable tunnel connections for development environments.

## üöÄ Features
- **WebSocket Connection**: Establish a persistent connection with a remote proxy server.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Protocol**: Supports tunneling for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: If the connection is dropped, Tunnelize automatically retries.
- **Simple CLI**: Intuitive command-line interface for fast setup and usage.
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Dynamically adjust logging levels (debug, info, log, warn, error) for better control.
- **Persistent Log Levels**: The log level persists across sessions.

## üì¶ Installation

To install Tunnelize globally as an NPM package, run:

```bash
npm install -g tunnelize
```

Once installed, you can use the `tunnelize` command from anywhere.

## üîß Usage

To start Tunnelize, use the following command:

```bash
tunnelize <protocol> <port>
```

**Options:**

| Parameter  | Description                     | Default |
|------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| `protocol` | Either `http` or `https`         | `http`  |
| `port`     | Port number to connect on localhost | 8080   |

### Examples

   ```

2. **Start a tunnel for HTTPS on port 443**

   tunnelize https 443
   ```

3. **Set log level to debug**

   tunnelize loglevel debug
   ```

4. **Show help information**
   ```bash

   ```

## üîê Environment Variables

You can customize the remote proxy server URL using environment variables.

```
